This directory has various sample files created by The Text Pattern Generator.
The files have also been converted to other document formats, such as Open Document
Text (ODT). Also the CSV files created by using this command:

  gcc tpl-csv-001.c; ./a.out "0,99,10" > file0005.csv

can then be used for spreadsheets.
