The Text Pattern Generator, also known as Textpatgen is a very useful utility
that generates a text file containing data, designed for users to practice
their editing skills using any text editor or word processor. Also using a
word processor such as Libreoffice, you can also test out various fonts, sizes
and colours using the generated text from Textpatgen.
