----- 14-CPP-IDE -----

This section allows you to create Text Pattern Generator files by using
a C++ Integrated Development Environment, also known as an IDE. This means
you can do this from tablets and smartphones that often do not have access
to a C++ Compiler.

All the Textpatgen Template files listed here do not require command line
arguments, and there is also no writing to files. However, you may have to
do some Cut, Copy, and Paste instructions to save your programs.
